# Final Project

--> OMNIROID - Small 2D Pixel platformer game made using GLFW, FMOD, OPENGL 3.3, C++ 2017, ENTT, ASEPRITE, LDTK, with main focus being placed on visuals - Mykyta Pasternatskyi <--

The source code for the project is located under Development/Source

## IMPORTANT NOTE: THE GAME HAS A MEMORY LEAK, REPLAY WORKS, HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY EATEN BY THE GAME INCREASES.


## Requirements

### General Requirements for all game projects

* Handed-in version on Gitlab must be running and in a playable state
* Must be replayable easily
* Must have an intro screen and/or help screen that explains how to play the game. A complete outsider must be able to understand what they should do
* At the end of a game (or round) it must be clear if the player won or lost
* You must go slightly beyond the base game idea (i.e. you must add *something*)
* Must use all the programming topics we discussed (functions, arrays, objects)
* Must have a reasonable amount of pre-planning (also to be committed to this repository)
* Should be one of the suggested game principles. (Exceptions only when discussed in advance!)
* Can go way beyond the original idea
* Any Topic / Style / Theme is allowed
